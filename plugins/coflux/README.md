# coflux plugin for Claude Code

Connects Claude Code to the [coflux](https://github.com/myWsq/coflux) agent command center: one daemon per
machine runs the PTYs that host agent sessions, and the web/mobile app shows every workspace's live turn state
so a human can supervise many parallel agents and take over at any time.

This directory is the plugin's **delivery directory**: self-contained and installable as is. The
`myWsq/plugins` marketplace collects the whole directory at a pinned commit SHA (maintained in
`myWsq/plugins-builder`); installers only need the marketplace. Codex installs the same plugin from the same
marketplace and runs the same `hooks/hooks.json` and `.mcp.json`.

## Components

- **hooks/** — three kinds of hooks in one file:
  - `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`
    and `Notification` are forwarded to the `cofluxd hook claude` messenger, which relays them to the local daemon;
    the daemon maps events to turn states (active / approval / question / done) shown in the coflux sidebar. When
    `cofluxd` is not installed or the daemon is down, the messenger exits silently and never disturbs the agent.
  - `SessionStart` runs `scripts/session-context.sh`: inside a coflux terminal (`COFLUX_WORKSPACE_ID` set) it prints
    a `<coflux-session>` block with the session's six `COFLUX_*` coordinates, the one rule (local commands inside
    the workspace, MCP only to leave it) and a pointer to the skill. It fires on every session source, so the block
    comes back after context compaction. Outside coflux it prints nothing.
  - `PreToolUse` with `matcher: "Bash"` runs `scripts/guard-git-worktree.mjs`: when `COFLUX_PROJECT_ID` is set it
    denies `git worktree add|remove|move` and points the agent to the MCP tools `create_workspace` /
    `remove_workspace` (a self-made worktree is invisible to the user and cannot host a terminal). `list`, `prune`
    and the other read-only subcommands pass; outside a coflux project it never intervenes; without `node` it stays
    silent.
- **skills/coflux/** — teaches an agent running inside a coflux terminal to externalize long tasks, parallel work
  and requests for help into real terminals the user can see and take over. One rule for the split: **anything
  that closes locally uses the zero-credential local commands** (`cofluxd terminal/progress/notify/ports`); only
  leaving the workspace (child workspaces, other workspaces or devices) goes through the center's `coflux` MCP
  server.
- **.mcp.json** — declares the center's `coflux` MCP server (Streamable HTTP + OAuth 2.1) with the public URL
  `https://api.coflux.dev/mcp` hard-coded. Do not write `${COFLUX_MCP_URL:-…}` here: Claude Code expands it, but
  Codex (installing this plugin from the same marketplace) parses it verbatim as the URL and fails with
  `invalid MCP server URL`, taking the whole MCP server down. For a self-hosted center or local development add a
  server by hand (`COFLUX_MCP_URL` is injected by the daemon and is the center URL + `/mcp`):
  `claude mcp add --transport http coflux "$COFLUX_MCP_URL"` / `codex mcp add coflux --url "$COFLUX_MCP_URL"`.
  In Claude Code the plugin's entry is named `plugin:coflux:coflux`, so it does not collide with a hand-added
  `coflux`; leave the public one unauthorized in that case. `timeout` is 660 s to cover `wait_terminal`'s 600 s
  ceiling. Authorization is one click on Authenticate for `coflux` in Claude Code's `/mcp` menu; tokens refresh
  automatically afterwards.

## Runtime requirements

- The [`cofluxd`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cofluxd) CLI installed globally (`npm i -g cofluxd`) and
  registered (`cofluxd up`). Without it the messenger hooks are silent no-ops and the local commands are
  unavailable.
- One OAuth authorization for MCP: Claude Code does not open the browser by itself; pick `coflux` in the `/mcp`
  menu and choose Authenticate, after which tokens refresh automatically.
- `COFLUX_*` variables appear in sessions only after the machine's daemon has been upgraded
  (`cofluxd update && cofluxd restart`).
- Codex asks the user to trust each new hook entry once; until then that entry does not run.

## Privacy boundary

The messenger hooks forward only the event name, notification type, agent session id, in-flight background task
count and messenger pid; prompts, replies and notification bodies never leave the machine. The session block is
built from environment variables only and never calls the daemon. MCP access is scoped to the current account,
with credentials stored by Claude Code.

## Migrating from manual hook configuration

If you previously wired `cofluxd hook claude` by hand in `~/.claude/settings.json`, remove those `hooks` entries
after installing this plugin; otherwise every event fires twice (the merged state stays correct, it is just
wasted work).

## Maintenance

- The skill's single source is `packages/cli/skills/coflux/SKILL.md` in the repository (shipped in the npm package
  for Codex users); sync it here with `node scripts/sync-claude-plugin.mjs`, and CI checks that the two copies
  match.
- Any change in this directory bumps `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (strict SemVer increase). Commit
  and push, then update `origin.sha` in plugins-builder's `catalog/plugins/coflux.json` and release through its
  flow.
