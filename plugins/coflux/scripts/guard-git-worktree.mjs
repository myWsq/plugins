// Claude Code PreToolUse hook (plan 095; `add` released in plan 104): inside a coflux project session, block
// `git worktree remove|move` and steer the agent to the center MCP's remove_workspace. Removing a worktree by hand
// leaves an orphan workspace record behind — nothing in coflux ever deletes it, because the directory watcher
// only reports 0/0 for a directory that disappeared.
//
// `git worktree add` is allowed since plan 104: coflux now follows the agent into a worktree (EnterWorktree,
// ExitWorktree, resume and Claude Code's own cleanup all move the terminal's owning workspace, registering an
// unknown worktree first), so a worktree created here is no longer invisible to the user.
//
// Contract (Claude Code hooks): stdin is one JSON document (tool_name / tool_input.command / cwd ...). To block,
// write one **pure JSON** decision to stdout and exit 0; otherwise write **not a single byte** and exit 0
// (= no opinion, the normal permission flow applies). Every anomaly (not in a coflux project, stdin not JSON,
// tool is not Bash) must be "no opinion"; never block by mistake. Debug output goes to stderr only
// (COFLUX_HOOK_DEBUG=1); one extra byte on stdout breaks decision parsing.
//
// Known gap: the check keys on COFLUX_PROJECT_ID alone and does not verify that the repository the command
// targets belongs to that project, so the same commands against another repository from inside a coflux
// session are blocked too (see plan 096 maintenance notes).
