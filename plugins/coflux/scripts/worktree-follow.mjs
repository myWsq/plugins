// Claude Code hook of the coflux plugin (plan 104): make coflux follow the agent into a git worktree.
//
// `EnterWorktree` switches a *live* session into a worktree (its own, created under
// `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` on branch `worktree-<name>`, or an existing one passed by path),
// `ExitWorktree` switches back, and `WorktreeRemove` fires when Claude Code cleans a worktree up on
// exit. Without this hook the terminal keeps hanging under the workspace it was opened in: the
// sidebar, the turn state, the diff stats and "which branch" all point at the wrong place, and the
// worktree itself does not exist for coflux at all.
//
// This script hands the path to the local, zero-credential `cofluxd` command; the daemon resolves
// the worktree's identity, the center verifies it and moves the terminal's *owning* workspace,
// registering the worktree as a child workspace first when it is not known yet. The PTY, the
// session and the turn state are untouched — only the ownership moves.
//
// Which path:
//   PostToolUse EnterWorktree / ExitWorktree → the payload's `cwd` (already the worktree root after
//     entering, already the original directory after exiting, per the hooks contract);
//   WorktreeRemove → the payload's `worktree_path` (the directory is, or is about to be, gone).
//
// The path to act on always travels as an argument, never as the child's working directory: on
// WorktreeRemove the session's cwd is typically the worktree being deleted, and spawning inside a
// directory that no longer exists fails before `cofluxd` even starts.
//
// Contract (Claude Code hooks): stdin is one JSON document. On PostToolUse, print one **pure JSON**
// object whose `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` carries the new coordinates, so the agent sees
// them beside the tool result in the very turn that moved. In every other case write **not a single
// byte** and exit 0: not inside coflux, stdin not JSON, an unexpected event, the ownership did not
// actually change (`ExitWorktree` back to where the terminal already is, a normal startup), `cofluxd`
// missing, the daemon down or too old to know the command, the center refusing (another repository,
// a directory workspace, not a git directory). Never disturb the agent. Debug output goes to stderr
// only (COFLUX_HOOK_DEBUG=1).
//
// SessionStart is deliberately *not* handled here: `session-context.sh` performs that locate itself
// and prints the resulting workspace id in the `<coflux-session>` block, so a `--resume` into a
// worktree lands on the right coordinates without two hooks racing over the same move.
