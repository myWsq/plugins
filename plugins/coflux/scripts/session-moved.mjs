// Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook (plan 102; ownership from the daemon since plan 104): tell the
// agent when its working directory sits in a *different* coflux workspace than the one this terminal
// currently belongs to.
//
// A plain `cd <path>` moves a live session (same conversation, no restart) to another directory, and
// a coflux child workspace is just a registered git worktree, so a session whose terminal belongs to
// workspace A can end up working inside workspace B. From then on the local `cofluxd` commands act on
// B (the daemon resolves the caller's cwd) while the terminal still hangs under A in the sidebar.
// Without this block the agent would keep passing A's id to the coflux MCP tools.
//
// Both ids come from `cofluxd workspace`, never from $COFLUX_WORKSPACE_ID: that variable is frozen
// when the PTY is spawned and only means "where this terminal was opened", so it goes stale as soon
// as coflux follows the agent into a worktree (plan 104) — comparing against it would report a move
// on every prompt forever after. The variable is used for one thing only: telling whether this
// session is inside a coflux terminal at all.
//
// Contract (Claude Code hooks): stdin is one JSON document (cwd / prompt / session_id ...); a
// UserPromptSubmit hook's stdout is added to the model context, so print the block as plain text
// starting with "<" (never JSON) when the workspaces differ, and **not a single byte** in every other
// case: no COFLUX_WORKSPACE_ID (not inside coflux), stdin not JSON, `cofluxd` missing or failing,
// same workspace. Always exit 0. Debug output goes to stderr only (COFLUX_HOOK_DEBUG=1).
//
// Stateless on purpose: while the session stays moved the block is printed on every prompt, so it
// also comes back after a context compaction. The cost is that the block arrives with the *next*
// prompt, not in the turn that moved: an agent that has to call an MCP tool right after moving runs
// `cofluxd workspace` itself (see the coflux skill).
